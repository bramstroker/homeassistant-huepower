Real power sensor
=================

In the yaml configuration (functionality not available through the webUI) you can add the following configuration
to use an existing power sensor and let powercalc create the energy sensors and utility meters for it:

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: light.toilet
          power_sensor_id: sensor.toilet_light_power
          force_energy_sensor_creation: true # optional

This also enables you to combine virtual power sensors (created with powercalc) and existing power sensors in your HA installation into
a group. Without this configuration option power_sensor_id that would not be possible.

If you don't define `force_energy_sensor_creation` or you set it to `false` an energy sensor will not be created if the device already
has an energy sensor. This can be a problem if you want to create an energy sensor for an MQTT device with multiple energy and power
sensors already in it.
