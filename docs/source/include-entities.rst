==============================
Dynamically including entities
==============================

Powercalc provides several methods to automatically include a bunch of entities in a group with the ``include`` option.
In addition to that you can use filters to exclude certain entities.

.. note::
    only entities will be included which are in the `supported models`_ list (these can be auto configured). You can combine ``include`` and ``entities`` to extend the group with custom configured entities.

Include
=======

Area
----

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: Outdoor
        include:
          area: outdoor

This can also be mixed with the ``entities`` option, to add or override entities to the group. i.e.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: Outdoor
        include:
          area: outdoor
        entities:
          - entity_id: light.frontdoor
            fixed:
              power: 100

Group
-----

Includes entities from an existing Home Assistant `group <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/>`_ or `light group <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.group/>`_)

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: Livingroom lights
        include:
          group: group.livingroom_lights

Domain
------

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: All lights
        include:
          domain: light

Template
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: All indoor lights
        include:
          template: {{expand('group.all_indoor_lights')|map(attribute='entity_id')|list}}

.. warning::
    The template option sometimes does not work correctly because of loading order of components in HA which powercalc cannot influence.
    So it's actually discouraged to use this and should only be used when you have no other options.

Filters
=======

Domain
------

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        create_group: Outdoor lights
        include:
          area: outdoor
          filter:
            domain: light

This will include only light entities from area outdoor.

You can also filter by multiple domains:

.. code-block:: yaml

  filter:
    domain:
      - light
      - switch
